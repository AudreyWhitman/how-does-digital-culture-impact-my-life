            How Does Digital Culture Impact My Life?</h3>
           <p>
Digital culture has advanced life into a tumultuous blur. The online culture that we are
surrounded by has fostered a fast-paced movement of innovation. I’ve noticed the most
development through my school life, my social life, and the way I purchase products and
services.
The education system has endured an endless remodel due to countless digital updates. I
am constantly immersed in these changes through my schooling. I understand that the program
and path that I’ve chosen will bind me to digital culture for the rest of my life. Thankfully, this is
something I find interesting and exciting. Though I also am conscious of the stress that learning
to use the thousands of digital tools that exist will challenge me. Digital culture in schools is
quickly evolving and as a GBDA student I will need to keep up.
The way in which people interact with one another has been reconstructed again and
again in recent years. Online interactions are more common, especially after the world went into
hiding throughout our battle with COVID-19. I find myself taking advantage of these digital
opportunities even now, while living on my own in Waterloo. Facetiming my parents is my
favorite way to connect with them while living so far away. I am also an active user of social
media. Most often, I enjoy interacting with friends online but have experienced the anxiety that
comes with posting, sharing and viewing photos. The way I tend to relationships online
continues to quickly change as applications update and I move through stages of my life.
E-commerce systems and online advertisements have become the leading choice of
shopping methods and product viewing. I use these platforms in my day-to-day life. Since
beginning to cook for myself I am an avid user of Walmart’s online flyer when planning my
meals for the week. I also shamelessly shop online between classes and while waiting for the 
bus. Looking for clothing, furniture, and weekend activities is made easier with online shopping
options. Easy access to shopping can also be dangerous. When becoming stressed I feel the need
to buy, which isn’t a habit I can fall into while living on a student budget. With the quickly
growing world of e-commerce, students like me must learn to master self-control.
Closely analyzing the effects digital culture has on my education, my relationships, and
my spending has given me clarity on both the positive and negative consequences that I face.
The fast pace of the digital world offers so many new and exciting opportunities but, in turn, also
creates a sense of stress or pressure to adapt. Undoubtedly, digital culture has created a
generation that adapts quickly with new, online experiences. I find it difficult to decide whether
digital culture has stunted or sustained my growth. Rather, I think, it would be more alluring to
leave you with the question; how fast can we go?</p></th>
